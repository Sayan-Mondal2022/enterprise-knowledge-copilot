# Enterprise Knowledge Copilot

This project implements an Enterprise Knowledge Base Copilot that enables employees to query internal documentation using natural language.

It leverages semantic search powered by a vector database and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to return accurate, step-by-step answers grounded in organizational knowledge such as policies, SOPs, and technical documentation.
